the Person class contains an object of the Address class

there are two main driver examples to test them:
the first driver (main1.cpp) only tests the address class
the second driver (main2.cpp) tests both classes;
note that the person object is created using an existing address object.

the Makefile creates both targets (main1 , main2)
you can also use it to create one of the targets (e.g.: make main1)
